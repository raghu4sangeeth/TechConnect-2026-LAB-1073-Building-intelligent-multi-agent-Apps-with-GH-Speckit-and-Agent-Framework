# LAB 181: Building Intelligent Multi-Agent Apps with Github Spec-Kit and Agent Framework 🤖

Welcome to an exciting hands-on journey into **agentic AI development**! In this comprehensive lab, you'll master the latest technologies and patterns for building production-ready AI applications that **think, decide, and act autonomously**.  
We will leverage **GitHub Spec-Kit** for specification-driven development and **Microsoft Agent Framework** to create a robust multi-agent system.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Build

A **fully functional multi-agent customer service system** that intelligently handles customer inquiries across billing, orders, and support—deployed to Azure with enterprise-grade security and observability.

Imagine AI agents that don't just answer questions—they:

- ✨ **Understand context** and customer history
- 🎯 **Route intelligently** to the right specialist agent
- ⚡ **Act autonomously** by processing returns, checking status, and escalating when needed
- 🔒 **Maintain security** with human-in-the-loop controls
- 📊 **Scale reliably** on Azure infrastructure
